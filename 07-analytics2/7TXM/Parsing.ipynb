Some of these basic concepts include Part-of-Speech(POS) Tagging, Statistical Language Modeling, Syntactic, Semantic and Sentiment Analysis, Normalization, Tokenization, Dependency Parsing, and Constituency Parsing, among others.\n",

    "- Dependency Parsing (DP) refers to examining the dependencies between the words of a sentence to analyze its grammatical structure. Based on this, a sentence is broken into several components. The mechanism is based on the concept that there is a direct link between every linguistic unit of a sentence. These links are termed dependencies. "

    "- The relations between every linguistic unit, or word, of the sentence, is indicated using directed arcs in a typed dependency structure. As labelled in the diagram, the root of the tree “prefer” forms the head of the above sentence. \n",
    "- The relationship between any two words is marked by a dependency tag. For instance, the word “flight” modifies the meaning of the noun “Denver.” Therefore, you can notice a dependency from flight -> Denver where the flight is the head and Denver is the child or dependent. It is denoted by nmod which represents a nominal modifier. \n",
    "- This forms the case for dependency between every two words where one acts as the head and the other is the dependent.\n",
    "- Dependency structures are directed graphs that satisfy the following constraints:\n",
    "- They have a single designated root node that has no incoming arcs.\n",
    "- Each node has one incoming edge except the root node.\n",
    "- There is a unique path to each node from the root node"
