<b>About Jupyter</b>
<p>

Jupyter notebooks2 provide an incredible interactive environment for coding in python. Without getting into too many details, jupyter notebooks let you run and edit python code in your browser. They allow you to write markdown and latex alongside your code, and display any graphics you generate. The browser renders them as nice-looking documents, and you can export them to PDF or HTML files. The nearest analog in R world is probably rmarkdown, with some differences that will become apparent.
